Comments from peer review:

Folders are organized correctly, and the new codes and existing codes 
follow the tidyverse style. 

I suggest adding code chunk name for each code chunk. 
Also, it seems like the answer for question 6 is missing.
Aside from these, everything else looks great! 



Comments from instructor:

Remember not to save the all environment into a .Rdata file.
Only use file.Rdata explicitly within the code to save large/slow
computations and always to store single objects, not the whole
environment. 

You may also add extra spaces to align code elements. for example you 
can align the assignment operators on lines 73-75. 

It is good you took the code for writing paths relative to the root of 
the project. However, the example should several alternatives; it would be
preferable that you choose one of them rather than mixing them. 

Lastly the argument popP is not named in accordance to the style. You may
change it to pop_prop. 

You did an excellent job adjusting to the style
and adding the figures is a great idea to make those comparisons easier
to perform. Note however, that the x-axis is not correctly ordered by
age group. Also, the comparisons between countries would be easier if
you put together the lines for Kenya and Sweden on the same plot.
